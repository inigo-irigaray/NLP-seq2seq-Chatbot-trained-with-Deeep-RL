# Leveraging the power of Deep Reinforcement Learning for training NLP algorithms


This project / work empirically shows the benefits of combining deep reinforcement learning (DLR) methods with popular Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms in the pursuit of state-of-the-art results using a very simple database as benchmark. 

**1. Preliminaries.** Introduces a conceptual background on NLP systems and state-of-the-art algorithms for conversational modelling, 

**2. seq2seq with REINFORCE - the algorithms.** Details the specifics of the algorithms used for this particular experiment and the core structure of the approximation models employed.

**3. Training.** Analyses the progress, duration and statistics of the two different training methods until halting.

**4. Results & Discussion.** Tests the chatbot agent generated from the model ina free Telegram environment.

**5. Future work.** Explores avenues of interest for future research.
